title: Employment dataset Tutorial
description: This tutorial explains how to use Employment Dataset
---

### Introduction

The dataset contains the US Employment and Unemployment rates since 1940 from USA Bureau of Labor Statistics.


### Example Application : US Employment rates application (Java)

***Introduction***

US Employment rates application is a Java Spring application which is deployed as a microservice.
The example also uses Skaffold which handles the workflow for building, pushing and deploying your application, allowing you to focus on what matters most: writing code.

***Architecture***

![architecture](_images/arch.png)

This application consists of a Java backend and a React frontend that is displaying data from a dataset. The frontend is included in the Java backend.

***Code Structure***

![codestructure](_images/employment-app-structure.png)

It follows a simple modular and MVC pattern. There are 2 folders that are of our interest:
- k8s :  This contains all the deployment and service yaml for the application. This defines the deployment and exposure of our application.
- backend: This contains all the backend code made using Java Spring. The frontend build in React is included in the backend.

### Try the example

Get the application code
```execute
cd /home/student/projects && git clone https://github.com/Andi-Cirjaliu/edge-java-react-dataset-deploy.git
```

Copy the dataset into application folder
```execute
cp -R employment_dataset edge-java-react-dataset-deploy/backend
```

Install and start the application using skaffold tool
```execute
cd /home/student/projects/edge-java-react-dataset-deploy && skaffold config set default-repo localhost:5000 && skaffold run
```

### Access the example application

Click on the Key icon on the dashboard and copy the value under the `DNS` section and `IP` field

URL :  http://##DNS.ip##:30091

### To Deploy changes to Kubernetes in Dev Mode

Go to Developer Dashboard tab, it will provide you with the IDE along with the integrated terminal.  Click on the bottom status bar and select `TERMINAL`. 

k8s folder contains all the manifest files and defines the deployment strategy for the application.
One can execute them using :

```execute
kubectl apply -f k8s/
```

In this example , we use `Skaffold` which simplifies local development. You can deploy the application is DEV mode which keeps watching for the files changes and on any change, triggers the entire deployment process automatically without the user having to run and manage it manually.

Navigate to the example:

```execute
cd /home/student/projects/edge-java-react-dataset-deploy
```

```execute
skaffold dev
```

On exiting the command, Skaffold will automatically destroy all the resources it created with above command.


Also, you can use the `skaffold run` to deploy the changes onto Kubernetes as a normal mode. In this mode, the resources created remains unless the user deletes them.

### Clean up the Kubernetes resources (Example application)

You can delete all the application resources created by executing the following command:

```execute
kubectl delete -f k8s/
```
